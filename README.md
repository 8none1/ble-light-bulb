# Bluetooth Smart Light Bulb control using ESP32
Control a BLE Consmart/Triones/Flyidea light bulb with ESP32. 

Since HUE lights are expensive I was looking for an cheap alternative solution. While searching on AliExpress I found this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000262654874.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.5c6a4c4d3CjxVb light bulb for US $4.84 which can be controlled using BLE. Decided to buy one light and give it a go

Sinric Pro integration next
